My personal portfolio page 

## How it started
This site was started as a hobby project in 2017 with the first commit being from the Github Page Generator. Initially developed with basic [Bootstrap] framework, I switched to JavaScript and started a complete [revamp][revamp], with idea of making it a blog for all my works and thoughts.

### Frameworks and libraries used

1. [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org), [Bootstrap] (http://getbootstrap.com/) (Frontend framework)
2. [Angular Material](https://material.angularjs.org)(UI library)
3. [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) (Static Site Generator)


The frameworks that I've used are completely opensource.



### Future plans
1. HTML5 Canvas
2. AMP support
3. Backend support

Future plan path includes making the site AMP enabled and using Canvas for animations and interactions.
