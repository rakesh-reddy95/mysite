					Feeding upon the daily trends and developments in technology and science for survival, I has a zeal to be in the cutting edge of technology.<br>
					Frontend Web Development is one area which I has good experience with.<br> Some of the frameworks that I has experience with are: Bootstrap, JQuery upon CSS & HTML.
					<br> Java remains as my favourite programming language. Hence learnt the core and advanced (Servlets and JSP)  part  in detail.<br>
					<br>Some of my works in Java include:<br>
					1. The input translator by using Internationalization concept, <br>
					2. Test my luck program where a user can test his luck<br>
					   by inputting a number and the computer returns the boolean output either lucky or unlucky.<br>
					3. A website to display the Lecture notes by logging in. ( Based on JSP and MySQL database)<br>
					Apart from the curriculum I am a Blog writer in the <a href="">Words from my life</a>. It is my novice pen<br>
					in the field of blogging. Nevertheless it has received a good response.<br>
